ROPGuard is a system for runtime detection and prevention of return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. It works by defining a set of checks that are performed when certain OS functions are called to determine if those functions are called from the ROP code or as a result of normal program execution. The system can be applied at runtime to any process and has a low CPU and memory overhead. The detailed project documentation can be found [here](https://ropguard.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/ropguard.pdf) (right-click, save-as if the direct link doesn't work for you) or [here](https://ropguard.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/ropguard.doc).

ROPGuard won the second prize at the [Microsoft's BlueHat Prize contest](http://www.microsoft.com/security/bluehatprize/) at Black Hat USA 2012. The project hosted here is exactly the same as the project I submitted to the contest, minus one embarrassing bug (thanks, Elias).

The code and other project files provided here are for educational purposes only. If you are interested in running ROPGuard to protect your computer, I recommend you download [Microsoft EMET](http://www.microsoft.com/emet) instead, as it implements protection mechanisms from ROPGuard (see: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2012/Jul12/07-25BlueHatPrizePR.aspx), but also contains many reliability improvements and is actively maintained. I'd like to thank Elias Bachaalany of Microsoft for not only implementing ROPGuard technology into EMET but also improving it in every way.
